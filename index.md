<!--author-->

I am a senior studying electrical engineering at the University of Idaho.
My primary interests are radio-frequency communication and signals processing and
electromagnetics. I am fascinated by space exploration, and plan to apply 
my knowledge and skills to advance our understanding of space. 

I have collected some examples of my work in this website, and will continually add
projects - for classes, personal projects, professional work, etc - as I work on them.
