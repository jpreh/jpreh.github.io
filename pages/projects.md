# NASA Undergraduate Student Instrument Project (USIP)
### Developing a Local Positioning System
!["derivation of a ranging operation"](/pages/docs/ranging_op.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}
This is my design of a two-way time transfer method of finding the distance between two 
software defined radios. Ultimately, SDR1 and SDR2 will transmit on different frequencies.

!["simple RF detectors"](/pages/docs/jp_rf_detectors.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}
One of my prior designs involved using radio frequency detectors and precise timers
to determine time of flight of a radio wave pulse. I built too of them, but they are not
sensitive enough and that would require too large a bandwidth.

!["testing SDR"](/pages/docs/jp_sdr_test.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}
Here, I am testing correlation with a software defined radio and GNU Radio running on
my laptop.

### High Altitude Balloon Multispectral Imager
!["camera system bracket"](/pages/docs/hab_imager_explosion.png){:class="img-responsive"}
I designed a 3D printed mount for four Raspberry Pi zeros, cameras, and lenses. Each lens 
would pass near UV and IR frequencies.

!["payload release device"](/pages/docs/cutdown_drawing.PNG){:class="img-responsive"}
This is a 3D printed payload release device that I designed for the imaging payload. It 
holds the linear actuator, which releases a loop of string on command that releases the
payload from the balloon. 


# ECE 476 - Digital Filtering
In this project, I designed a digital filter.
