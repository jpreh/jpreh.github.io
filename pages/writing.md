# ENGL 317 - Technical Writing
This is a whitepaper detailing the usability of the circuit simulators LTspice and QUCS. I found that LTspice is much more intuitive and easy to use than QUCS, especially for beginners.

# PHIL 240 - Belief and Reality
This is a paper I wrote about how I believe things came to be the way they are. It is very
subjective and obviously not related to engineering, but I think it is a good piece of writing.
